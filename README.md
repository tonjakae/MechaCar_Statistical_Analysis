### 1.) Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 
The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. That is to say, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Conversely, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

### 2.) Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
The p-Value for this model, is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

### 3.) Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
This model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. This mmodel does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
